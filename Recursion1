// we have to give int a = 0; int b = 1, and n is the number upto where you have to print the fibonacci series. 
// for ex: n = 10
// So when we call fibonacci function in the main method
// we will get the output: 
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34


// in this way we can use recursion to print the fibonacci series
