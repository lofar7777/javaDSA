# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms – Learning Path

This repository documents my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey.  
It contains **small, focused code snippets** and practice problems implemented while studying DSA concepts step by step.

The goal of this repo is **clarity, consistency, and strong fundamentals**, not just solutions.
